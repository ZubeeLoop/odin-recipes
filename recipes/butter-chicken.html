    <h4>STEPS:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let it marinate for 30 minutes to an hour or overnight if time allows.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside, you will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and ginger and saute for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let it cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and Salt. Let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red color</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple of tablespoons of water.</li>
        <li>Pour the pureed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and crushed methi or fenugreek leaves through the sauce. Add the chicken back into the pan with the juices and let it cook for for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with fresh, hot garlic butter rice or Naan bread.</li>
